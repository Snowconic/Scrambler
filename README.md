Scrambler
=========

Scrambles the letters inside the words of sentences while leaving the first and last characters alone, then copies the result to clipboard automatically

To be added or changed:

Fix code so that opening punctuation does not cause the first letter of the word to be scrambled with the rest

Find ways to optimize code using other methods (Will look into re.split over string.split as a possiblity)

Find ways to copy the result to the clipboard without the use of pyperclip

May decide to add function that asks the user if they want the word to be scrambled 100% of the time
(As current system has a small chance of not scrambling the word)
